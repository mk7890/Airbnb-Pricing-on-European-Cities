# Airbnb-Pricing-in-European-Cities
This project will provide a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb pricing dynamics in European cities by identifying key determinants of pricing The insights generated will benefit both hosts and travelers, offering actionable recommendations for optimizing listings and making informed booking decisions.  

# Project Overview
The "Airbnb Prices in European Cities" project aims to analyze and visualize pricing trends, geographical patterns, and guest satisfaction metrics across some of Europe's most popular cities. Using Tableau visualizations, this project explores the determinants of Airbnb prices, including room types, proximity to city centers, cleanliness ratings, and host attributes. By combining data from multiple cities and time periods (weekdays vs. weekends), I aim to provide actionable insights into pricing strategies for hosts and identify key factors influencing profitability as well as offer advice to travelers/tourists on accommodation pricing.

# Summary
This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings across ten European cities such as Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna . The dataset includes attributes like room type, host characteristics, guest satisfaction ratings, distance from city centers, and geographical coordinates. Using Python for data preparation, combined with Tableau for visualization, Iâ€™ll create an interactive dashboard to explore pricing patterns and strategies. The final deliverable is a set of worksheets and a dashboard that highlight key insights, enabling stakeholders (hosts and travellers/tourists) to make informed decisions about Airbnb pricing strategies.

# Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of Airbnb listings across major European cities, both hosts and travelers face challenges in optimizing their decisions. Hosts seek to competitively price their listings and improve visibility and guest satisfaction, while travelers aim to find affordable, quality accommodations near points of interest.
